- Create surface smoothing (repair?) tool
- Remove unstruc-layers. Extract out any useful functionality
- Clean up coding conventions. Not much consistency at the moment
- Look into missing intersection where one object is swallowed by another

(unstruc-offset)
- Look into analyzing volume element quality
  - Possibly use mesh smoothing to clean up
- Decide on final smoothing method/options
